\title{Generate probabilities with quantiles from a metalog object.
This is done through a newtons method approximation.}
\usage{
pmetalog(m, q, term = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{metalog object created from \code{metalog()}}

\item{q}{vector of quantiles}

\item{term}{which metalog distribution to sample from}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of probabilities corresponding to the q quantile
  vector
}
\description{
Generate probabilities with quantiles from a metalog object.
This is done through a newtons method approximation.
